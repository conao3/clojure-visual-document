  Returns a sorted sequence of the items in coll. If no comparator is
    supplied, uses compare.  comparator must implement
    java.util.Comparator.  Guaranteed to be stable: equal elements will
    not be reordered.  If coll is a Java array, it will be modified.  To
    avoid this, sort a copy of the array.
