  Coerces coll to a (possibly empty) sequence, if it is not already
    one. Will not force a lazy seq. (sequence nil) yields (), When a
    transducer is supplied, returns a lazy sequence of applications of
    the transform to the items in coll(s), i.e. to the set of first
    items of each coll, followed by the set of second
    items in each coll, until any one of the colls is exhausted.  Any
    remaining items in other colls are ignored. The transform should accept
    number-of-colls arguments
