doc: "(deftype name [fields*]  options* specs*)\n\n  Options are expressed as sequential keywords and arguments (in any order).\n\n  Supported options:\n  :load-ns - if true, importing the type class will cause the\n             namespace in which the type was defined to be loaded.\n             Defaults to false.\n\n  Each spec consists of a protocol or interface name followed by zero\n  or more method bodies:\n\n  protocol-or-interface-or-Object\n  (methodName [args*] body)*\n\n  Dynamically generates compiled bytecode for class with the given\n  name, in a package with the same name as the current namespace, the\n  given fields, and, optionally, methods for protocols and/or\n  interfaces. \n\n  The class will have the (by default, immutable) fields named by\n  fields, which can have type hints. Protocols/interfaces and methods\n  are optional. The only methods that can be supplied are those\n  declared in the protocols/interfaces.  Note that method bodies are\n  not closures, the local environment includes only the named fields,\n  and those fields can be accessed directly. Fields can be qualified\n  with the metadata :volatile-mutable true or :unsynchronized-mutable\n  true, at which point (set! afield aval) will be supported in method\n  bodies. Note well that mutable fields are extremely difficult to use\n  correctly, and are present only to facilitate the building of higher\n  level constructs, such as Clojure's reference types, in Clojure\n  itself. They are for experts only - if the semantics and\n  implications of :volatile-mutable or :unsynchronized-mutable are not\n  immediately apparent to you, you should not be using them.\n\n  Method definitions take the form:\n\n  (methodname [args*] body)\n\n  The argument and return types can be hinted on the arg and\n  methodname symbols. If not supplied, they will be inferred, so type\n  hints should be reserved for disambiguation.\n\n  Methods should be supplied for all methods of the desired\n  protocol(s) and interface(s). You can also define overrides for\n  methods of Object. Note that a parameter must be supplied to\n  correspond to the target object ('this' in Java parlance). Thus\n  methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the\n  interface declarations. Note also that recur calls to the method\n  head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied\n  automatically and can not be substituted.\n\n  In the method bodies, the (unqualified) name can be used to name the\n  class (for calls to new, instance? etc).\n\n  When AOT compiling, generates compiled bytecode for a class with the\n  given name (a symbol), prepends the current ns as the package, and\n  writes the .class file to the *compile-path* directory.\n\n  One constructor will be defined, taking the designated fields.  Note\n  that the field names __meta, __extmap, __hash and __hasheq are currently\n  reserved and should not be used when defining your own types.\n\n  Given (deftype TypeName ...), a factory function called ->TypeName\n  will be defined, taking positional parameters for the fields"
