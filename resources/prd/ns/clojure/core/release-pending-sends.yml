  Normally, actions sent directly or indirectly during another action
    are held until the action completes (changes the agent's
    state). This function can be used to dispatch any pending sent
    actions immediately. This has no impact on actions sent during a
    transaction, which are still held until commit. If no action is
    occurring, does nothing. Returns the number of actions dispatched.
