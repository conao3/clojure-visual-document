doc: "reify creates an object implementing a protocol or interface.\n  reify is a macro with the following structure:\n\n (reify options* specs*)\n  \n  Currently there are no options.\n\n  Each spec consists of the protocol or interface name followed by zero\n  or more method bodies:\n\n  protocol-or-interface-or-Object\n  (methodName [args+] body)*\n\n  Methods should be supplied for all methods of the desired\n  protocol(s) and interface(s). You can also define overrides for\n  methods of Object. Note that the first parameter must be supplied to\n  correspond to the target object ('this' in Java parlance). Thus\n  methods for interfaces will take one more argument than do the\n  interface declarations.  Note also that recur calls to the method\n  head should *not* pass the target object, it will be supplied\n  automatically and can not be substituted.\n\n  The return type can be indicated by a type hint on the method name,\n  and arg types can be indicated by a type hint on arg names. If you\n  leave out all hints, reify will try to match on same name/arity\n  method in the protocol(s)/interface(s) - this is preferred. If you\n  supply any hints at all, no inference is done, so all hints (or\n  default of Object) must be correct, for both arguments and return\n  type. If a method is overloaded in a protocol/interface, multiple\n  independent method definitions must be supplied.  If overloaded with\n  same arity in an interface you must specify complete hints to\n  disambiguate - a missing hint implies Object.\n\n  Method heads are recursion points for recur, as in a fn. The method\n  bodies of reify are lexical closures, and can refer to the surrounding\n  local scope:\n  \n  (str (let [f \"foo\"] \n         (reify Object\n           (toString [this] f))))\n  == \"foo\"\n\n  (seq (let [f \"foo\"] \n         (reify clojure.lang.Seqable\n           (seq [this] (seq f)))))\n  == (\\f \\o \\o)\n  \n  reify always implements clojure.lang.IObj and transfers meta\n  data of the form to the created object.\n  \n  (meta ^{:k :v} (reify Object (toString [this] \"foo\")))\n  == {:k :v}"
