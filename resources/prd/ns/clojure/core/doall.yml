  When lazy sequences are produced via functions that have side
    effects, any effects other than those needed to produce the first
    element in the seq do not occur until the seq is consumed. doall can
    be used to force any effects. Walks through the successive nexts of
    the seq, retains the head and returns it, thus causing the entire
    seq to reside in memory at one time.
