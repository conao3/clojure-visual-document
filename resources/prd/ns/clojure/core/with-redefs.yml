  binding => var-symbol temp-value-expr

    Temporarily redefines Vars while executing the body.  The
    temp-value-exprs will be evaluated and each resulting value will
    replace in parallel the root value of its Var.  After the body is
    executed, the root values of all the Vars will be set back to their
    old values.  These temporary changes will be visible in all threads.
    Useful for mocking out functions during testing.
