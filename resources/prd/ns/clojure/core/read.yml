  Reads the next object from stream, which must be an instance of
    java.io.PushbackReader or some derivee.  stream defaults to the
    current value of *in*.

    Opts is a persistent map with valid keys:
      :read-cond - :allow to process reader conditionals, or
                   :preserve to keep all branches
      :features - persistent set of feature keywords for reader conditionals
      :eof - on eof, return value unless :eofthrow, then throw.
             if not specified, will throw

    Note that read can execute code (controlled by *read-eval*),
    and as such should be used only with trusted sources.

    For data structure interop use clojure.edn/read
