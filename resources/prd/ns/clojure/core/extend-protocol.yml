doc: "Useful when you want to provide several implementations of the same\n  protocol all at once. Takes a single protocol and the implementation\n  of that protocol for one or more types. Expands into calls to\n  extend-type:\n\n  (extend-protocol Protocol\n    AType\n      (foo [x] ...)\n      (bar [x y] ...)\n    BType\n      (foo [x] ...)\n      (bar [x y] ...)\n    AClass\n      (foo [x] ...)\n      (bar [x y] ...)\n    nil\n      (foo [x] ...)\n      (bar [x y] ...))\n\n  expands into:\n\n  (do\n   (clojure.core/extend-type AType Protocol \n     (foo [x] ...) \n     (bar [x y] ...))\n   (clojure.core/extend-type BType Protocol \n     (foo [x] ...) \n     (bar [x y] ...))\n   (clojure.core/extend-type AClass Protocol \n     (foo [x] ...) \n     (bar [x y] ...))\n   (clojure.core/extend-type nil Protocol \n     (foo [x] ...) \n     (bar [x y] ...)))"
