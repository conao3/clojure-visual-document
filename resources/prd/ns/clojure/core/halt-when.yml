doc: |-
  Returns a transducer that ends transduction when pred returns true
    for an input. When retf is supplied it must be a fn of 2 arguments -
    it will be passed the (completed) result so far and the input that
    triggered the predicate, and its return value (if it does not throw
    an exception) will be the return value of the transducer. If retf
    is not supplied, the input that triggered the predicate will be
    returned. If the predicate never returns true the transduction is
    unaffected.
