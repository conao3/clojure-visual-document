  Returns a lazy sequence consisting of the result of applying f to 0
    and the first item of coll, followed by applying f to 1 and the second
    item in coll, etc, until coll is exhausted. Thus function f should
    accept 2 arguments, index and item. Returns a stateful transducer when
    no collection is provided.
