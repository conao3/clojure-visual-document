  Returns a lazy sequence consisting of the result of applying f to
    the set of first items of each coll, followed by applying f to the
    set of second items in each coll, until any one of the colls is
    exhausted.  Any remaining items in other colls are ignored. Function
    f should accept number-of-colls arguments. Returns a transducer when
    no collection is provided.
