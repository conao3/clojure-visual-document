- [f, init, coll]
doc: |-
  Reduces an associative collection. f should be a function of 3
    arguments. Returns the result of applying f to init, the first key
    and the first value in coll, then applying f to that result and the
    2nd key and value, etc. If coll contains no entries, returns init
    and f is not called. Note that reduce-kv is supported on vectors,
    where the keys will be the ordinals.
