  Temporarily redefines Vars during a call to func.  Each val of
    binding-map will replace the root value of its key which must be
    a Var.  After func is called with no args, the root values of all
    the Vars will be set back to their old values.  These temporary
    changes will be visible in all threads.  Useful for mocking out
    functions during testing.
