  Mix final collection hash for ordered or unordered collections.
     hash-basis is the combined collection hash, count is the number
     of elements included in the basis. Note this is the hash code
     consistent with =, different from .hashCode.
     See http://clojure.org/data_structures#hash for full algorithms.
