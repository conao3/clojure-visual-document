  binding => var-symbol init-expr

    Creates new bindings for the (already-existing) vars, with the
    supplied initial values, executes the exprs in an implicit do, then
    re-establishes the bindings that existed before.  The new bindings
    are made in parallel (unlike let); all init-exprs are evaluated
    before the vars are bound to their new values.
