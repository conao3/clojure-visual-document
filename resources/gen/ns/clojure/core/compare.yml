  Comparator. Returns a negative number, zero, or a positive number
    when x is logically 'less than', 'equal to', or 'greater than'
    y. Same as Java x.compareTo(y) except it also works for nil, and
    compares numbers and collections in a type-independent manner. x
    must implement Comparable
