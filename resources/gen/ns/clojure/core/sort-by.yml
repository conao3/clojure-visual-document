  Returns a sorted sequence of the items in coll, where the sort
    order is determined by comparing (keyfn item).  If no comparator is
    supplied, uses compare.  comparator must implement
    java.util.Comparator.  Guaranteed to be stable: equal elements will
    not be reordered.  If coll is a Java array, it will be modified.  To
    avoid this, sort a copy of the array.
