  Returns a new, transient version of the collection, in constant time.

    Transients support a parallel set of 'changing' operations, with similar names
    followed by ! - assoc!, conj! etc. These do the same things as their persistent
    counterparts except the return values are themselves transient.

    Note in particular that transients are not designed to be bashed in-place. You
    must capture and use the return value in the next call. In this way, they support
    the same code structure as the functional persistent code they replace.
