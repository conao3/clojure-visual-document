  A map of keys to options.
    Note, when binding dynamically make sure to merge with previous value.
    Supported options:
    :elide-meta - a collection of metadata keys to elide during compilation.
    :disable-locals-clearing - set to true to disable clearing, useful for using a debugger
    :direct-linking - set to true to use direct static invocation of functions, rather than vars
      Note that call sites compiled with direct linking will not be affected by var redefinition.
      Use ^:redef (or ^:dynamic) on a var to prevent direct linking and allow redefinition.
    See https://clojure.org/reference/compilation for more information.
