  Runs the exprs (in an implicit do) in a transaction that encompasses
    exprs and any nested calls.  Starts a transaction if none is already
    running on this thread. Any uncaught exception will abort the
    transaction and flow out of dosync. The exprs may be run more than
    once, but any effects on Refs will be atomic.
