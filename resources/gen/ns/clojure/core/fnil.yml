  Takes a function f, and returns a function that calls f, replacing
    a nil first argument to f with the supplied value x. Higher arity
    versions can replace arguments in the second and third
    positions (y, z). Note that the function f can take any number of
    arguments, not just the one(s) being nil-patched.
