  Returns a promise object that can be read with deref/@, and set,
    once only, with deliver. Calls to deref/@ prior to delivery will
    block, unless the variant of deref with timeout is used. All
    subsequent derefs will return the same delivered value without
    blocking. See also - realized?.
