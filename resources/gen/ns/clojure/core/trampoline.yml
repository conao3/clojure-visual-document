  trampoline can be used to convert algorithms requiring mutual
    recursion without stack consumption. Calls f with supplied args, if
    any. If f returns a fn, calls that fn with no arguments, and
    continues to repeat, until the return value is not a fn, then
    returns that non-fn value. Note that if you want to return a fn as a
    final value, you must wrap it in some data structure and unpack it
    after trampoline returns.
