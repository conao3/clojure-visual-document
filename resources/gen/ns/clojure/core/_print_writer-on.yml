  implements java.io.PrintWriter given flush-fn, which will be called
    when .flush() is called, with a string built up since the last call to .flush().
    if not nil, close-fn will be called with no arguments when .close is called.
    autoflush? determines if the PrintWriter will autoflush, false by default.
