  Returns a lazy sequence of vectors of n items each, at offsets step
    apart. If step is not supplied, defaults to n, i.e. the partitions
    do not overlap. If a pad collection is supplied, use its elements as
    necessary to complete last partition upto n items. In case there are
    not enough padding elements, return a partition with less than n items.
